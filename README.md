# Healthcare-exploratory-data-analysis
Description  Exploratory Data Analysis on a messy healthcare dataset using Python. The project includes data cleaning, handling missing values, outlier treatment, and insightful visualizations to analyze patient demographics, diseases, treatment costs, hospital types, and outcomes.
 
  
  Data Cleaning Steps Performed
  
	•	Handled missing values in age, gender, disease, insurance, hospital_type, length_of_stay, and outcome
	•	Converted data types (object → datetime, float → int where applicable)
	•	Checked and treated invalid and inconsistent values
	•	Removed or capped outliers in treatment cost and length of stay
	•	Verified duplicate records



 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 The following analysis was performed:
	•	Age distribution of patients
	•	Gender-wise patient count
	•	Disease frequency analysis
	•	Hospital type vs treatment cost
	•	Insurance impact on treatment cost
	•	Length of stay analysis
	•	Outcome distribution (Recovered, Improved, Deceased)


 Key Insights  
 
	•	Majority of patients are aged between 30–60 years
	•	Private hospitals show higher average treatment cost than government hospitals
	•	Patients with insurance tend to have higher treatment costs
	•	Certain diseases result in longer hospital stays
	•	Recovery rate is higher compared to deceased cases



 Tools & Technologies Used
 
	•	Python
	•	Pandas
	•	NumPy
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Seaborn
	•	Jupyter Notebook


 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to handle real-world messy healthcare data, apply data cleaning techniques, and extract meaningful insights using EDA.
It is suitable for data analyst / data science portfolio projects.
